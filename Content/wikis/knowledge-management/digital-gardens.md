# Digital Gardens

A digital garden is a personal knowledge management system that emphasizes growth, exploration, and connection over linear organization.

## Characteristics

### Growth-Oriented
- Notes evolve over time
- Ideas develop and mature
- Connections emerge naturally

### Non-Linear Structure
- No strict hierarchy
- Multiple entry points
- Branching pathways

### Learning in Public
- Share work-in-progress
- Embrace imperfection
- Invite collaboration

## Comparison with Traditional Blogs

| Digital Garden | Traditional Blog |
|----------------|------------------|
| Evergreen content | Time-based posts |
| Bidirectional links | Linear progression |
| Work in progress | Polished articles |
| Topic clustering | Chronological order |

## Tools and Platforms

- **Obsidian**: Local-first with graph view
- **Roam Research**: Block-based with backlinking
- **Notion**: All-in-one workspace
- **TiddlyWiki**: Non-linear documentation
- **Custom solutions**: Built with static site generators

## Benefits

1. **Better retention**: Active linking reinforces learning
2. **Serendipitous discovery**: Unexpected connections surface
3. **Reduced pressure**: No need for perfect, finished content
4. **Compound knowledge**: Ideas build upon each other

## Getting Started

1. Choose your tools
2. Start with what you know
3. Link liberally
4. Tend regularly
5. Share openly

A digital garden is less about the destination and more about the journey of learning and discovery.
