# Atomic Thinking

Atomic thinking is the practice of breaking down complex ideas into their smallest, most fundamental components. Each "atom" of thought should be:

- **Self-contained**: Understandable on its own
- **Focused**: Covering a single concept
- **Linkable**: Able to connect with other atomic thoughts

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Forces you to understand ideas deeply
2. **Flexibility**: Ideas can be recombined in new ways
3. **Discovery**: Connections emerge naturally
