# Zettelkasten Method

A note-taking and knowledge management system developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The name means "slip box" in German.

## Core Principles

1. **Atomic Notes**: Each note contains one idea
2. **Unique Identifiers**: Every note has a distinct ID
3. **Linking**: Notes reference each other
4. **No Hierarchy**: Flat structure with emergent organization

## Implementation

- Write notes in your own words
- Link liberally between related concepts
- Use consistent formatting and metadata
- Review and refine connections regularly

The power comes from the network of connections, not individual notes.
