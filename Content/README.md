# Content Directory

This directory contains all the markdown files for your digital garden. Organize your content in folders and subfolders as needed.

## Structure

- **zettels/**: Atomic notes and ideas
- **wikis/**: Comprehensive topic guides
- **topics/**: Subject-specific content
- **logs/**: Daily notes and journals
- **concepts/**: Abstract ideas and definitions

Each markdown file should include frontmatter with metadata like id, title, path, type, tags, and dates.
