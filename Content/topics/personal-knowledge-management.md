# Personal Knowledge Management

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is the practice of collecting, organizing, and utilizing information to support learning, decision-making, and creative work.

## Core Components

### Capture
- Note-taking from books, articles, lectures
- Saving web content and resources
- Recording thoughts and ideas
- Documenting experiences

### Organize
- Categorization and tagging
- Creating connections between concepts
- Building hierarchies and taxonomies
- Maintaining consistent structure

### Connect
- Linking related information
- Identifying patterns and themes
- Creating concept maps
- Building knowledge networks

### Create
- Synthesizing information into new insights
- Writing summaries and analyses
- Generating original content
- Applying knowledge to problems

## Popular Methods

### Zettelkasten
- Atomic notes with unique identifiers
- Emphasis on linking and emergence
- Flat structure without hierarchy

### PARA Method
- Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives
- Action-oriented organization
- Clear boundaries between categories

### Johnny Decimal System
- Numerical organization (10.10, 20.15, etc.)
- Limited categories force focus
- Easy to navigate and remember

### Getting Things Done (GTD)
- Trusted system for all inputs
- Regular review and processing
- Context-based organization

## Tools and Technologies

### Note-Taking Apps
- **Obsidian**: Local files with graph view
- **Roam Research**: Block-based linking
- **Notion**: Database-driven organization
- **RemNote**: Spaced repetition integration

### Traditional Methods
- Physical notebooks and index cards
- Filing systems and binders
- Whiteboard and mind maps
- Voice recordings and sketches

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Don't over-engineer initially
2. **Be consistent**: Develop and stick to conventions
3. **Review regularly**: Maintain and prune your system
4. **Focus on retrieval**: Optimize for finding information later
5. **Embrace evolution**: Allow your system to grow and change

## Challenges

- **Information overload**: Too much input, not enough processing
- **Tool switching**: Constantly changing systems
- **Maintenance burden**: System becomes work itself
- **Perfect system fallacy**: Endless tweaking without use

## Benefits

- Enhanced learning and retention
- Better decision-making capabilities
- Increased creativity and innovation
- Reduced cognitive load
- Personal intellectual growth

The goal is not to create the perfect system, but to build one that serves your specific needs and actually gets used.
