I've been having the most fun this year surfing the web, using tools people have built, building my own version of tools I enjoy or want to build, take this app I am currently using to draft this post for example. I wish I could make it easy for anyone to use this app the way I use it, and I ACTUALLY CAN. I just don't know if i have the energy to make it happen.

You might ask, what exactly do you need to do?

I came across a project last night *19th of May 2025* â€” [fumadocs.dev](https://fumadocs.dev). 
This is a simple project for writing documentations but you can obviously use other use cases. I came across this project via [nikiv's](https://nikiv.dev/) website after I found his [learn-anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) project (a wonderful tool btw) realised he used it for his website too. I was amazed that this was a full application that you could install, run and use for anything outside the main purpose and I thought; what if I turned my notes app [NoteIt-Down](https://notes.lilyslab.xyz) into an npm package? A library that you could install, add your own environment variables in the designated spaces in order to have a robust but minimalist notes app?

I don't know who would want to use this but when I am done fixing the bugs the project currently has, I might explore this. Although this might work well for tech savvy people, non-tech savvy people might find it hard to use. The problem here is database, once you have your own database, using the app is pretty straight forward.

After so much digression, back to the point. I was chatting with a gym acquaintance today *20 May 2025*  about how much fun I've ben having on the web, the blogs I've found, what I've been doing and even about AI. From 2, we became 5 people talking about AI and it was great. Everyone agreed that AI was good in its own way but as much as there are advantages, there'll also be disadvantages. 

This is my last month paying for any LLM, I might pay for Copilot since its cheaper than windsurf, cursor, lovable and v0 but let's see. I want to actually go back to learning and reading about things, while still having fun in building, let's see how that goes.

*I aimed to get this post to 500 words but currently it is 396. I'll allow the post to marinate a bit and see if I'll have something new to add on my next edit.*
