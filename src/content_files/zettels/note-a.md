Currently I’m at that point in my life where I am doing nothing. I don’t know what next, I have a feeling but can’t really place it.

I’ve worked as a developer for 4 years, I sometimes enjoy it but I don’t know if I do anymore. I decided to do a career switch but with the way the world is advancing I don’t know if anyone will be willing to take a chance on me.

I know I am smart, I know I’m resilient, intelligent too but sometimes I think, am I really all that?
Am I that and I have no job? No source of income? No love life? No hobbies? 

I go to the gym to workout but leave before I’m able to workout because I feel overstimulated, overwhelmed, also because I see everyone else, at least what I’m able to see of them, and I feel small, also because I am small, well smaller in age.
Irrespective, I didn’t feel this way last year because I could afford being there but not this time around.
