# Building My Custom Digital Garden

I already have a digital garden and workshop, but I want a dedicated garden specifically for my zettels and wikis to help me learn better, take better notes for the future, improve my vocabulary, and expand my knowledge.

---


## Home Page

Welcome to my Braindump ‚Äî my [[personal knowledge management]] space of evolving knowledge where I collect, connect, and grow ideas over time. 

Braindump is my personal [[digital garden]], a space to cultivate and connect my thoughts, learnings, and ideas over time. Unlike a traditional blog or a fleeting note-taking app, a digital garden is a living collection of interconnected notes that evolve as you do.

My garden is made up of two main types of notes:
- **[[Personal wikis]]:** Detailed, fact-based articles with sources and structured links, focused on concepts I‚Äôm learning or exploring.
- **[[Atomic notes (zettels)]]:** Short, personal reflections or single ideas, often linked to wikis or other notes to spark new connections.

Notes in this garden grow organically. They start as ‚Äúseedlings‚Äù (raw ideas), develop into ‚Äúbudding notes" (linked and refined), and eventually become ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù (well-developed and stable).

Everything is organized with categories and tags for easy navigation. You can explore by topic, follow links between notes, or use the search to find what interests you.

If you want to learn more about [[my note-taking process]] or [[how to create your own digital garden]], check out my notes.

Happy exploring!

## About

Hi, my name is Lilian. I am an indie developer, content curator, lifestyle connoisseur, and personal trainer. At this point, I can call myself whatever I choose.

I write code for work, vibe code for fun, and read code for growth.

I spend most mornings working out or cosplaying as the personal trainer of some rich person.

I surf the web for fun, enjoy going down *rabbit holes**, bookmarking links, *curating content* to read and revisit.

I don‚Äôt enjoy social media because I dislike the *performative nature** where everyone feels pressured to entertain followers. I don‚Äôt enjoy being an entertainer but don‚Äôt mind being entertained. To me, entertaining means writing casually about topics I enjoy in less than 1000 words.

There aren‚Äôt many interesting things about me, but here are a few:
- I have *8 piercings and more to come*.
- I‚Äôve gone blonde and ginger (ginger was my favorite).
- My last relationship was 6 years ago (very crazy).
- I‚Äôve been in 2 situationships during that period (do not recommend).
- I have no favorite artist, actor, movie, or song.

## Getting Started

Welcome to my digital garden! üå±

This is your guide to exploring, navigating, and making the most of this evolving knowledge space.

---

### What You'll Find Here

- **Personal Wikis:**  
  In-depth, fact-based articles on concepts, tools, and topics I‚Äôm learning or exploring. Each wiki is well-structured, cited, and interconnected with related notes.

- **Atomic Notes (Zettels):**  
  Short, focused notes capturing single ideas, insights, or reflections. These are often linked to wikis and other notes, forming a web of knowledge.

---

### How to Navigate

- **Categories & Tags:**  
  Use categories to browse broad subjects. Tags help you filter by specific topics, note status (seedling, budding, evergreen), or type (wiki, zettel).

- **Backlinks & Links:**  
  Follow internal links and backlinks to see how ideas connect and evolve. Don‚Äôt be afraid to wander‚Äîthe best discoveries are often unplanned!

- **Search:**  
  Use the search bar to quickly find notes, topics, or keywords.

---

### Note Lifecycle

- **Seedlings:** Raw, early ideas or questions.
- **Budding Notes:** Notes with some development and connections.
- **Evergreen Notes:** Well-developed, reliable reference material.

You‚Äôll see these statuses as tags or indicators on each note.

### Brainboard (Instead of Dashboard for Home Page)

**Wikis:** Subjects, topics, concepts, and ideas ‚Äî all fact-based with citations, connected using hyperlinks, and having backlinks as well. Properly structured content with child notes.

**Notes:** Personal understanding of concepts and ideas relating to wikis. Notes on learnings and topics, all linked to their parent wiki and related notes.

Notes can be created without parent wikis, but all wikis need child notes to help explain concepts.

*Tips*‚Üí Hover effect on linked notes shows the first few lines of the linked note. Example https://www.ssp.sh/brain/writing-within-the-app-vs.-a-note-app / https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes
