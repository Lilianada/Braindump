## Roadmap for Learning Secondary School Math (JSS1–SS3)

**JSS1 (Junior Secondary School 1)**
- Number systems (whole numbers, decimals, Roman numerals)[5].
- Factors, multiples, HCF, LCM[5].
- Introduction to binary numbers and basic operations[5].
- Fractions: types, simplification, operations[5].
- Percentages: conversion, calculations, word problems[5].
- Addition and subtraction (whole numbers, decimals, fractions)[5].
- Estimation and approximation (rounding, significant figures)[5].
- Introduction to algebraic symbols and simple equations[5].

**JSS2 (Junior Secondary School 2)**
- Review and deepen understanding of JSS1 concepts.
- Introduction to sets and set notation.
- More advanced operations with fractions, decimals, and percentages.
- Introduction to geometry: lines, angles, shapes, perimeter, area.
- Introduction to statistics: data collection, bar charts, mean, median, mode.
- Simple probability.
- Further work on algebra: expressions, equations, basic word problems.

**JSS3 (Junior Secondary School 3)**
- Advanced number bases and operations.
- More complex algebra: linear equations, inequalities, graphs.
- Geometry: circles, triangles, polygons, construction, and loci.
- Mensuration: area, volume, surface area of 3D shapes.
- Introduction to trigonometry: ratios, sine, cosine, tangent.
- Statistics: pie charts, histograms, cumulative frequency.
- Revision and preparation for external exams.

**SS1–SS3 (Senior Secondary School 1–3)**
- Algebra: quadratic equations, simultaneous equations, factorization.
- Functions, relations, and graphs.
- Advanced geometry and trigonometry.
- Calculus (introduction in SS3): differentiation and integration basics.
- Statistics and probability: permutations, combinations, probability distributions.
- Further mensuration: advanced area, volume, surface area problems.
- Vectors and matrices (SS2/SS3).
- Revision, past questions, and exam strategies.

## Tips

- **Set clear, achievable goals** for each stage.
- **Practice regularly**: daily short sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones.
- **Use a mix of resources**: textbooks, online courses, apps, and real-life practice.
- **Assess your progress** at the end of each stage and adjust your plan as needed.
- **Seek feedback** from teachers, tutors, or language/math communities.
