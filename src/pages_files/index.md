## Introduction

Welcome to [[Braindump]] — my [[digital garden]] and [[personal knowledge management]] space of evolving knowledge where I collect, connect, and grow ideas over time.

### What's Inside?

My garden is made up of two main types of notes:
*   **Personal wikis:** Detailed, fact-based articles with sources and structured links, focused on concepts I’m learning or exploring.
*   **Atomic notes (zettels):** Short, personal reflections or single ideas, often linked to wikis or other notes to spark new connections.

### How Notes Grow

Notes in this garden grow organically. They start as “seedlings” (raw ideas), develop into “budding notes" (linked and refined), and eventually become “evergreen” (well-developed and stable).

### Explore

Everything is organized with categories and tags for easy navigation. You can explore by topic, follow links between notes, or use the search to find what interests you.
