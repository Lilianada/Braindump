# Introduction

Welcome to my Braindump — my [[personal knowledge management]] space of evolving knowledge where I collect, connect, and grow ideas over time.

Braindump is my personal [[digital garden]], a space to cultivate and connect my thoughts, learnings, and ideas over time. Unlike a traditional blog or a fleeting note-taking app, a digital garden is a living collection of interconnected notes that evolve as you do.

### What's Inside?

My garden is made up of two main types of notes:
*   **[[Personal wikis]]:** Detailed, fact-based articles with sources and structured links, focused on concepts I’m learning or exploring.
*   **[[Atomic notes (zettels)]]:** Short, personal reflections or single ideas, often linked to wikis or other notes to spark new connections.

### How Notes Grow

Notes in this garden grow organically. They start as “seedlings” (raw ideas), develop into “budding notes" (linked and refined), and eventually become “evergreen” (well-developed and stable).

### Explore

Everything is organized with categories and tags for easy navigation. You can explore by topic, follow links between notes, or use the search to find what interests you.

Happy exploring!
