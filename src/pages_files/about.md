## About Me

Hi, my name is Lilian. I am an [[Indie developer]], content curator, [[lifestyle connoisseur]], and [[personal trainer]]. At this point, I can call myself whatever I choose.

I write code for work, vibe code for fun, and read code for growth.

I spend most mornings working out or cosplaying as the personal trainer of some rich person.

I surf the web for fun, enjoy going down [[rabbit holes]], bookmarking links, [[curating content]] to read and revisit.

I don’t enjoy social media because I dislike the *performative nature* where everyone feels pressured to entertain followers. I don’t enjoy being an entertainer but don’t mind being entertained. To me, entertaining means writing casually about topics I enjoy in less than 1000 words.

There aren’t many interesting things about me, but here are a few:
- I have *8 piercings and more to come*.
- I’ve gone blonde and ginger (ginger was my favorite).
- My last relationship was 6 years ago (very crazy).
- I’ve been in 2 situationships during that period (do not recommend).
- I have no favorite artist, actor, movie, or song.
