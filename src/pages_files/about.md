# About Braindump

Braindump is your personal digital garden, a space to cultivate and connect your thoughts, learnings, and ideas over time. 
Unlike a traditional blog or a fleeting note-taking app, a digital garden is a living collection of interconnected notes that evolve as you do.

## Key Concepts

*   **Atomic Notes:** Small, self-contained units of information focused on a single idea or concept.
*   **Linking:** Creating connections between notes to build a web of knowledge, inspired by the Zettelkasten method.
*   **Continuous Growth:** Notes are not static; they are meant to be revisited, updated, and expanded.
*   **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM):** A system for capturing, organizing, and retrieving your personal knowledge.

This application aims to provide a simple yet powerful interface for you to manage your digital garden. 
Think of it as a personal wiki, a commonplace book, and a journal, all rolled into one, where you can freely explore your intellectual landscape.

## How It (Will) Work

Content is (conceptually) stored in simple text files (like Markdown with frontmatter for metadata), allowing for easy editing and portability. The application then renders this content, providing features like:

*   A clear navigational structure through sidebars.
*   (Planned) Table of Contents for longer notes.
*   (Planned) Backlinks to see which other notes refer to the current one.
*   (Planned) Tagging and search functionalities to easily find information.

Welcome to your Braindump. Start planting your thoughts!
