# Documentation

This documentation page will guide you on how to use Braindump effectively. As the application evolves, this section will be updated with more detailed information.

## Getting Started

*   **Navigation:** Use the left sidebar to browse through different sections of your digital garden: Pages, Content Sections (like Zettels, Wikis), and Tags.
*   **Content Viewing:** Click on a note or topic in the sidebar to view its content in the main area.
*   **Theming:** Use the theme toggle (sun/moon icon) in the navbar to switch between light and dark modes.
*   **Fonts:** Use the font selector in the navbar to change the application's display font.

## Content Structure (Simulated)

Currently, the content is simulated using mock data within the application. The structure mirrors a file system:

```
src/
└── content/
    └── mockData.ts (defines the structure and content)

Example structure within mockData:
- Zettels/
  - Note A
  - Note B/
    - Sub Note A
- Wikis/
  - Programming/
    - JavaScript/
      - Conditional Rendering
...and so on.
```

## Future Features (Planned)

*   Actual MDX file processing.
*   Full-text search.
*   Dynamic Table of Contents generation.
*   Backlink display.
*   Editable notes directly within the app.
*   More robust tagging system.

Thank you for using Braindump! We hope it becomes a valuable tool for your personal knowledge management.
