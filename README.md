## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Firebase Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd braindump
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a Firebase project:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Enable Authentication (optional, for future features)

3. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Create a `src/lib/firebase.ts` file with your Firebase config:
   ```typescript
   import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
   import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "123456789",
     appId: "your-app-id"
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   export const db = getFirestore(app);
   ```

4. **Set up Firestore structure:**
   Create a collection called `notes` with documents containing:
   ```javascript
   {
     noteTitle: "Your Note Title",
     content: "# Your markdown content here",
     filePath: "path/to/your/note", // Used for routing
     slug: "your-note-slug",
     tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
     publish: true, // Only published notes are shown
     category: {
       id: "category-id",
       name: "note", // or "zettel", "topic", etc.
       color: "#color-hex"
     },
     createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
     updatedAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
   }
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Local Markdown Files (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use Firebase, you can modify the app to work with local markdown files:

1. **Create a content structure:**
   ```
   src/content_files/
   â”œâ”€â”€ notes/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ your-note.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ topics/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ your-topic.md
   â””â”€â”€ zettels/
       â””â”€â”€ your-zettel.md
   ```

2. **Markdown file format:**
   ```markdown
   ---
   id: "unique-id"
   title: "Your Note Title"
   path: "notes/your-note"
   slug: "your-note"
   type: "note"
   tags:
     - "tag1"
     - "tag2"
   created: "2025-01-01"
   lastUpdated: "2025-01-01"
   ---

   # Your content here

   This is your markdown content.
   ```

3. **Modify the data source:**
   You'll need to update the hooks and services to use local file imports instead of Firebase calls.
